I have two services. One daemon running in the background fetching tweets and Seding them to the SQS. Another thread fetches the tweets form SQS and sends it to SNS.  
I have created another request to service user requests. I have written angular js to interface a REST servlet. The SNS notifications will also be issued as a post request on this servlet. 
Properties required needs to be stored in properties file src.
